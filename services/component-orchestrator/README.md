The revolution in data synchronization â€” the Open Integration Hub enables simple data synchronization between any software applications and thus accelerates digitalisation

# Component Orchestrator

Orchestrates the flow's lifecycle. It creates queues in RabbitMQ and deploys Docker containers for each flow node on flow creation and cleans up deployments and secrets on flow deletion.

## How it works

The application works in a loop. During each loop iteration it makes sure, that all nodes for each flow have been deployed and asserts RabbitMQ queues and RabbitMQ user for each node.
If a flow has been deleted, the application removes the corresponding containers and RabbitMQ queues and RabbitMQ user.

### Handling flow updates

If a container is running an outdated version of node, it will be redeployed.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with enabled RBAC.
- RabbitMQ with enabled [Management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html).
- MongoDB

## Service Account

This service requires a service account with the following permissions:

- `components.any.read`
- `iam.token.create`
- `iam.token.delete`

## How to build

```docker
docker build -t openintegrationhub/component-orchestrator:latest -f Dockerfile ../../
```

or

```npm
VERSION=latest npm run build:docker
```

## How to deploy

Kubernetes descriptors can be found in the [k8s](./k8s) directory.

``` console
cd platform
kubectl apply -f ./k8s
```

**Note:** the env vars in the descriptors have to be changed according to the given environment.
